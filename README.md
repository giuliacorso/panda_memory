### Playing the Memory game interacting with a Panda Robot
With this project you will be able to play the memory game in a simulated environment with a Panda Robot.
Each turn the robot will flip two cubes showing them both to human facing it and toward the camera.
It will analyze them via a choosen Computer Vision algorithm in order to extract a descriptor for each cube 
and subsequently compare them with a similarity measure.
If a couple will be found, the two cubes will be moved to the boxes behind.

### Why this project? 
This project was developed as group project for the course of "Smart Robotics" done at the [University of Modena and Reggio Emilia](https://www.unimore.it/).
