# Panda Memory
This architecture enables you to engage in a memory game within a simulated environment against a Panda Robot.
In each turn, the robot will flip two cubes, showing them to both the human player and a camera. 
Employing a selected Computer Vision algorithm, it will analyze the cubes, extracting descriptors for each, 
and subsequently comparing them using a similarity measure. 
If a match is found, indicating identical cubes, the robot will move both cubes to designated boxes behind it.
